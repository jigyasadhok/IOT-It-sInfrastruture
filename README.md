# IOT-It-sInfrastruture
IoT stands for Internet of Things. It refers to the interconnectedness of physical devices, such as appliances and vehicles, that are embedded with software, sensors, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. This technology allows for the collection and sharing of data from a vast network of devices, creating opportunities for more efficient and automated systems.

Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment. In the upcoming years, IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services and practically change the way people lead their daily lives. Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, agriculture, smart cities, and smart homes are just a few of the categorical examples where IoT is strongly established. 

IOT is a system of interrelated things, computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people that are provided with unique identifiers. And the ability to transfer the data over a network requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

Characteristics of IoT
Massively scalable and efficient
IP-based addressing will no longer be suitable in the upcoming future.
An abundance of physical objects is present that do not use IP, so IoT is made possible.
Devices typically consume less power. When not in use, they should be automatically programmed to sleep.
A device that is connected to another device right now may not be connected in another instant of time.
Intermittent connectivity – IoT devices aren’t always connected. In order to save bandwidth and battery consumption, devices will be powered off periodically when not in use. Otherwise, connections might turn unreliable and thus prove to be inefficient.

Architecture of IoT
The architecture of IoT is divided into 4 different layers i.e. Sensing Layer, Network Layer, Data processing Layer, and Application Layer. 

Sensing Layer: The sensing layer is the first layer of the Internet of Things architecture and is responsible for collecting data from different sources. This layer includes sensors and actuators that are placed in the environment to gather information about temperature, humidity, light, sound, and other physical parameters. Wired or wireless communication protocols connect these devices to the network layer.
Network Layer: The network layer of an IoT architecture is responsible for providing communication and connectivity between devices in the IoT system. It includes protocols and technologies that enable devices to connect and communicate with each other and with the wider internet. Examples of network technologies that are commonly used in IoT include WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and cellular networks such as 4G and 5G technology. Additionally, the network layer may include gateways and routers that act as intermediaries between devices and the wider internet, and may also include security features such as encryption and authentication to protect against unauthorized access.
Data processing Layer: The data processing layer of IoT architecture refers to the software and hardware components that are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data from IoT devices. This layer is responsible for receiving raw data from the devices, processing it, and making it available for further analysis or action.The data processing layer includes a variety of technologies and tools, such as data management systems, analytics platforms, and machine learning algorithms. These tools are used to extract meaningful insights from the data and make decisions based on that data. Example of a technology used in the data processing layer is a data lake, which is a centralized repository for storing raw data from IoT devices. 
Application Layer: The application layer of IoT architecture is the topmost layer that interacts directly with the end-user. It is responsible for providing user-friendly interfaces and functionalities that enable users to access and control IoT devices.This layer includes various software and applications such as mobile apps, web portals, and other user interfaces that are designed to interact with the underlying IoT infrastructure. It also includes middleware services that allow different IoT devices and systems to communicate and share data seamlessly.

Applications of IoT in the World
 Smart Agriculture
Food is an integral part of life without which we cannot survive. However, it is an unfortunate fact that a lot of food is wasted in developed countries like America while people starve in poorer countries like Chad, Sudan, etc. One way to feed everyone is through better agricultural practices which can be enhanced using IoT applications.
Smart Vehicles
Smart vehicles or self-driving cars are Iot applications as they can be called are pretty dependent on IoT. These cars have a lot of features that are integrated with each other and need to communicate such as the sensors that handle navigation, various antennas, controls for speeding or slowing down, etc.
 Smart Home
Maybe one of the most famous applications of IoT is in Smart Homes. After all, who hasn’t heard about connecting all the home applications like lighting, air conditioners, locks, thermostat, etc. into a single system that can be controlled from your smartphone? These IoT devices are applications of IoT and becoming more and more popular these days because they allow you complete freedom to personalize your home as you want.
Smart Pollution Control
Pollution is one of the biggest problems in most of the cities in the world. Sometimes it’s not clear if we are inhaling oxygen or smog! In such a situation, IoT applications can be a big help in controlling pollution levels to more breathable standards. This can be done by collecting data related to city pollution like emissions from vehicles, pollen levels, airflow direction, weather, traffic levels, etc using various sensors in combination with IoT.
Smart Healthcare
There are many applications of IoT in the Healthcare Industry where doctors can monitor patients remotely through a web of interconnected devices and machines without needing to be in direct contact with them. This is very useful if the patients don’t have any serious problems or if they have any infectious diseases like COVID-19 these days. One of the most common uses of IoT applications in healthcare is using robots.
 Smart Cities
Cities can be made more efficient so that they require fewer resources and are more energy-efficient. This can be done with a combination of sensors in different capacities all over the city that can be used for various tasks ranging from managing the traffic, controlling handling waste management, creating smart buildings, optimizing streetlights, etc. There are many cities in the world that are working on incorporating IoT applications and becoming smarter such as Singapore, Geneva, Zurich, Oslo, etc.
Smart Retail
There is a way to make shopping even more exciting for customers and that’s to use the latest tech like IoT of course! Retail stores can make use of IoT applications in a wide range of operations to make shopping a much smoother experience for customers and also easier for employees. IoT can be used to handle inventory, improve store operations, reduce shoplifting and theft, and prevent long queues at the cashiers.


Most common protocols
AMQP
Short for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, AMQP is an open standard protocol used for more message-oriented middleware. As such, it enables messaging interoperability between systems, regardless of the message brokers or platforms being used. It offers security and interoperability, as well as reliability, even at a distance or over poor networks. It supports communications, even when systems aren't simultaneously available.
CoAP
The Internet Engineering Task Force Constrained RESTful Environments Working Group in 2013 launched CoAP, for Constrained Application Protocol, having designed it to work with HTTP-based IoT systems. CoAP relies on User Datagram Protocol to establish secure communications and enable data transmission between multiple points. Often used for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications, CoAP enables constrained devices to join an IoT environment, even with the presence of low bandwidth, low availability and/or low-energy devices.
 MQTT
Developed in 1999 and first known as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, it's now just MQTT. There is no longer any message queueing in this protocol. MQTT uses a publish-subscribe architecture to enable M2M communication. Its simple messaging protocol works with constrained devices and enables communication between multiple devices. It was designed to work in low-bandwidth situations, such as for sensors and mobile devices on unreliable networks. That capability makes it a commonly preferred option for connecting devices with a small code footprint, as well as for wireless networks with varying levels of latency stemming from bandwidth constraints or unreliable connections. MQTT, which started as a proprietary protocol, is now the leading open source protocol for connecting IoT and industrial IoT devices.
Wi-Fi
Given its pervasiveness in home, commercial and industrial buildings, Wi-Fi is a frequently used IoT protocol. It offers fast data transfer and is capable of processing large amounts of data. Wi-Fi is particularly well suited within LAN environments, with short- to medium-range distances. Moreover, Wi-Fi's multiple standards -- the most common in homes and some businesses being 802.11n -- give technologists options for deployment. However, many Wi-Fi standards, including the one commonly used in homes, is too power-consuming for some IoT use cases, particularly low-power/battery-powered devices. That limits Wi-Fi as an option for some deployments. Additionally, Wi-Fi's low range and low scalability also limit its feasibility for use in many IoT deployments.
XMPP
Dating back to the early 2000s when the Jabber open source community first designed its Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol for real-time human-to-human communication, XMPP is now used for M2M communication in lightweight middleware and for routing XML data. XMPP supports the real-time exchange of structured but extensible data between multiple entities on a network, and it's most often used for consumer-oriented IoT deployments, such as smart appliances. It's an open source protocol supported by the XMPP Standards Foundation.

#Dataflow in IoT
The dataflow in IoT (Internet of Things) encompasses the complete journey of data from its generation at the sensor level to its eventual consumption and utilization by users, devices, and applications. This flow is critical to the functionality of IoT ecosystems, enabling real-time monitoring, automated decision-making, and interactive control across diverse domains like healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, smart cities, and beyond.

Data Generation at Sensor Nodes and End Devices
The dataflow begins at the sensor nodes or end devices that are deployed in the physical environment to collect specific types of data. These devices form the foundation of any IoT system, acting as the interface between the physical world and digital systems.
Sensors: Sensors detect and measure physical parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, motion, light, sound, or chemical compositions. These devices capture real-time raw data from the environment.
Actuators: While sensors gather data, actuators perform actions based on commands received from the system. For example, turning on a light, adjusting a thermostat, or closing a valve.

Data Collection and Preprocessing at IoT Gateways
After sensors collect raw data, it is transmitted to IoT gateways or edge devices for initial aggregation and preprocessing. This stage reduces the amount of data sent to the cloud, optimizing bandwidth usage and improving response times.
Edge Devices: Perform real-time computations at the edge of the network to preprocess data, filter noise, and detect anomalies. They are especially useful in latency-sensitive applications such as industrial automation or autonomous vehicles.
IoT Gateways: Act as intermediaries between devices and the cloud. They aggregate data from multiple sensors, translate protocols (e.g., Zigbee to Wi-Fi), and ensure secure data transmission.


Data Transmission via Communication Networks
Data collected and preprocessed at the edge is sent to the cloud using various communication protocols and networks. This stage ensures secure and reliable data transmission, forming the backbone of IoT connectivity.
Communication Protocols: Protocols like MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, and AMQP facilitate the exchange of data between devices, gateways, and cloud platforms.
Network Technologies: Depending on the application, IoT systems use different network technologies:
Short-range: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or Z-Wave for local communication.
Long-range: Cellular networks (4G/5G), LPWAN technologies (LoRaWAN, Sigfox), or satellite networks for remote deployments.


Data Storage and Processing in the Cloud
Once data reaches the cloud, it undergoes storage, processing, and analysis. The cloud is the central hub for handling large volumes of IoT data, leveraging advanced computational power and scalable storage.
Data Storage: Cloud platforms like AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub, and Google Cloud IoT store historical and real-time data, allowing long-term analysis and trend monitoring.
Data Processing: The cloud processes raw data using various techniques such as:
Cleaning: Removing redundant or inaccurate data.
Analysis: Applying statistical or machine learning models to derive insights.
Visualization: Preparing data for display on dashboards or applications.
Decision-Making: Based on processed data, the system generates actionable insights or automated decisions.

Data Visualization and User Interaction
Processed data is sent to IoT dashboards or mobile applications for visualization and interaction. These interfaces allow users to monitor IoT devices, gain insights, and take actions.
IoT Dashboards: Provide a centralized view of device performance, data trends, and system status in real-time.
Mobile Applications: Extend dashboard functionality to smartphones, enabling users to interact with IoT systems on the go. They also send alerts or notifications about critical events.
Data Actuation and Feedback Loops
In many IoT systems, dataflow is bi-directional. Insights and decisions generated in the cloud or edge devices are sent back to actuators, completing the feedback loop.
Actuation: Based on processed data, commands are sent to actuators to perform actions in the physical world. For example:
A smart irrigation system turning on sprinklers when soil moisture levels are low.
A manufacturing robot adjusting operations based on sensor feedback.
Feedback Loops: IoT systems continuously collect, process, and act on new data, creating a dynamic, real-time control loop.
